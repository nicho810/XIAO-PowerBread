## Getting Started

### Hardware

- **XIAO Board**: The XIAO RP2040 is recommended, though other XIAO boards should work as well.(not tested)
- **XIAO PowerBread Board**: Clone or remix the design from this repository. Also you can get the hardware from [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/35842/).
- **Breadboard**: Fits standard breadboards for easy prototyping.
- **Power Supply**: Use a standard USB power source.

### Software

- **Remix the project**: Modify or remix the project using the provided Arduino source code.
- **Directly use compiled firmware**: Currenly, the code only test on XIAO RP2040, it is recommended to use UF2 method to upload the firmware to XIAO RP2040.

> UF2 upload method:
> 1. Download the compiled firmware file from [Release page](https://github.com/nicho810/XIAO-PowerBread/releases)
> 2. Connect XIAO to PC/MAC via USB (Make sure it is a 4 pin USB cable)
> 3. press the B(Boot) button on XIAO and **holding it**, then press the R(Reset) button on XIAO at the same time. Then release all buttons
> 4. You should able to see a USB drive Name:RPI-RP2 on you PC/MAC.
> 5. Drag and drop the firmware file(*.uf2) to the RPI-RP2 drive, the file will be uploaded to XIAO.
> 6. After a few seconds, the XIAO will reset and boot into the firmware.

### Planned Software Features
- [x] Real-time current sensor data displayed on the LCD.
- [x] Dial wheel to adjust the UI for different viewing angles.
- [x] Line chart mode to visualize power usage for each channel.
- [x] Count mode to count average(second, minute, all time) and peak current consumption for each channel.
- [x] Allow to save settings data to EEPROM.
- [ ] USB-Serial mode as a debug tool.
- [ ] PWM output on IO0 and IO1.
- [ ] ADC reading from IO0 and IO1.

### Documentation
- [System Config Explanation](Docs/sysConfig.md)
  - Default mode setting
  - Shunt resistor setting (20mOhm, 50mOhm)
  - Serial output setting (Human readable mode,  Arduino plotter mode)
  - Line chart setting (Chart refresh rate)

### Troubleshooting
1. The display is not responding
   - Pls make sure you are using the latest firmware, the latest firmware have some bug fix for the stability.
   - Try to reset the XIAO by pressing the reset button on the XIAO board.
2. The display is not working
   - if the red LED on XIAO is blinking, it means the INA3221 is not connected correctly, pls check the I2C pin connection.
   - if the red LED on XIAO is not blinking, it means the display is not driven properly, pls check the SPI pin connection.
3. The current value is not correct
   - Pls check the shunt resistor value, and set it correctly in the sysConfig. (e.g. 20 for 20mOhm, 50 for 50mOhm) -> [System Config Explanation](Docs/sysConfig.md)
4. Both of the Volatage shows on display is 0V
   - Pls check the power-on switch, it should be on the down side. (UP side is OFF, DOWN side is ON)
