## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: View essential power metrics at a glance—no multimeter needed. The built-in display shows real-time voltage, current, and power data.
2. **High-Current Output**: Deliver up to 1.5A of 3.3V power, ideal for most breadboard-based electronics projects.
3. **Built-in LCD Display**: Stay informed with real-time feedback—critical power data is displayed clearly on the integrated LCD.
4. **Plug-and-Play Design**: Compatible with standard breadboards, simply plug in, power up, and start prototyping without extra setup.
5. **Open-Source and Seeed Studio XIAO Compatibility**: Compatible with almost all XIAO Dev Boards (the support for XIAO SAMD21 and XIAO RA4M1 is still on the way), this open-source design provides flexibility for future extensions like USB-serial communication and PWM control.
6. **Dual-Channel Voltage and Current Sensing**: Equipped with the INA3221 sensor for dual-channel voltage and current monitoring—know what’s happening with every aspect of your power supply.
7. **Compact Powerhouse**: This compact design delivers both 3.3V and 5V outputs, optimizing your breadboard space without compromising on power.
8. **Multiple UI functions**: The UI can be switched between data monitoring, line chart, and statistic mode.

## Getting Started

### Hardware

- **XIAO Board**: The [XIAO RP2040](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html) is highly recommended, also you can use: [XIAO RP2350](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-RP2350-p-5944.html), [XIAO ESP32-C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html), [XIAO ESP32-S3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ESP32S3-p-5627.html), [XIAO ESP32-C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html). (Make sure to flash the firmware compatible with your board type)
- **XIAO PowerBread Board**: Clone or remix the design from this repository. Also you can get the hardware from [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/35842/).
- **Breadboard**: Fits standard breadboards for easy prototyping.
- **Power Supply**: Use a standard USB power source.

### Software

- **Remix the project**: Modify or remix the project using the provided Arduino source code.
- **Directly use compiled firmware**: 
  - For XIAO ESP32 series, it is recommended to use web based flash tool: https://powerbread-flasher.ioatlas.com/， check this tutorial for more details: [Flash Firmware for XIAO - ESP32 series](Docs/flash-firmware-for-esp32-series.md)
  - For XIAO RP2040/RP2350, it is recommended to use UF2 method to upload the firmware.

> UF2 upload method:
> 1. Download the compiled firmware file from [Release page](https://github.com/nicho810/XIAO-PowerBread/releases)
> 2. Connect XIAO to PC/MAC via USB (Make sure it is a 4 pin USB cable)
> 3. press the B(Boot) button on XIAO and **holding it**, then press the R(Reset) button on XIAO at the same time. Then release all buttons
> 4. You should able to see a USB drive Name:RPI-RP2 on you PC/MAC.
> 5. Drag and drop the firmware file(*.uf2) to the RPI-RP2 drive, the file will be uploaded to XIAO.
> 6. After a few seconds, the XIAO will reset and boot into the firmware.

### Planned Software Features

### Documentation
- [System Config Explanation](Docs/sysConfig.md)
  - Default mode setting
  - Shunt resistor setting (20mOhm, 50mOhm)
  - Serial output setting (Human readable mode,  Arduino plotter mode)
  - Line chart setting (Chart refresh rate)

### Troubleshooting
1. The display is not responding
   - Pls make sure you are using the latest firmware, the latest firmware have some bug fix for the stability.
   - Try to reset the XIAO by pressing the reset button on the XIAO board.
2. The display is not working
   - Please check the I2C and SPI pin connections, and ensure the XIAO is properly soldered the pins.
3. The current value is not correct
   - Pls check the shunt resistor value, and set it correctly in the sysConfig. (e.g. 20 for 20mOhm, 50 for 50mOhm) -> [System Config Explanation](Docs/sysConfig.md)
4. Both of the Volatage shows on display is 0V
   - Pls check the power-on switch, it should be on the down side. (UP side is OFF, DOWN side is ON)
